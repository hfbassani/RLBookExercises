### *Exercise 12.2:*

### ** The parameter λ characterizes how fast the exponential weightning in Figure 12,2 falls off, and thus how far into the future the λ-return algorithm looks in determining the update. But a rate factor such as λ is sometimes an awkward way of characterizing the speed of the decay. For some purposes it is better to specify a time constant, or half-life. What is the equation relating λ and the half-life, τλ, the time by which the weighting sequence will have fallen to half of its initial value?**

Queremos o tempo para que o valor é a metade do original, ou seja:

(1 - λ)λ^t = 1/2
ln((1 - λ)λ^t) = ln(1/2)
ln(1-λ) + t*ln(λ) = ln(1/2)
t*ln(λ) = ln(1/2) - ln(1-λ)
t = (ln(1/2) - ln(1-λ))/ln(λ)
t = ln(1/(2*(1 - λ)))/ln(λ)
t = (ln(2*(1 - λ))^(-1))/ln(λ)
t = -ln(2(1 - λ))/ln(λ)

O tempo de meia vida é t = -ln(2(1 - λ))/ln(λ)
