Exercise 5.1 Consider the diagrams on the right in Figure 5.1. Why does the estimated
value function jump up for the last two rows in the rear? Why does it drop off for the
whole last row on the left? Why are the frontmost values higher in the upper diagrams
than in the lower?

The value goes up on the last two rows because these are the rows the player can win.
It drops off on the last rows, bucause the dealer makes a draw with the player.
The values are higher on the front of the upper diagrams, because the player has an ace, which represents 1 or 11 on his starting hand.
